<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>A couple of months ago I wrote a CHIP-8 emulator in C++17 as I wanted to learn about emulation and expand my C++ knowledge outside of work. You can <a href="https://github.com/dominikrys/chip8">check out the source code</a> or <strong><a href="https://dominikrys.com/chip8">try it out online through the magic of WebAssembly</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll explain how I went about compiling the emulator which was designed to run natively on Windows and Linux, to also run on the web using WebAssembly.</p>
<p>My main motivation for getting this working on the web was that it was difficult download and get it running; I could send someone a pre-compiled binary or give building instructions, but neither of those options are guaranteed to work without extra effort involved. The whole concept of downloading and running programs also felt a bit dated given that these days it&rsquo;s rare that anyone leaves their web browser.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> came in. Emscripten is a toolchain which uses <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-ports/SDL2">LLVM</a> to compile C and C++ programs into <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm). WebAssembly is a binary instruction format which runs on modern web browsers and allows apps to run at near native speed. In theory, this was the perfect solution to my problem as I could get the emulator running from a web browser.</p>
<p>The idea was simple: compile my emulator using Emscripten, sort out any errors and deploy it on a website. An afternoon&rsquo;s work right? Turns out it wasn&rsquo;t that simple. There were a couple of pitfalls in the process, so to help anyone else embarking on a similar journey of compiling a loop-based C++ program running into WebAssembly, I thought I&rsquo;d write this post.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-emscripten">Setting up Emscripten</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up Emscripten and did all the development described in this post on a Windows 10 machine. The setup will look very similar on other platforms and a lot of the code/configuration I mention <em>should</em> work on Mac and Linux, and if not then with minimal adjustments.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm">Mozilla&rsquo;s article on compiling C/C++ modules to WebAssembly</a> was a great crash-course for working with Emscripten. I recommend it as a starting point if your goal is to compile a C or C++ program into Webassembly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note for Windows users:</strong> if you run <code>emsdk.bat</code> and nothing happens, check your Python install. Since Microsoft decided to have the <code>python</code> command <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-the-windows-10-may-2019-update/">redirect you to the Microsoft Store</a>, this may cause problems as when the command is called from within bath script (as in the case of <code>emsdk</code>) you won&rsquo;t get redirected to the store. To fix this you may need to either install Python from the Microsoft Store, or <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1461471">remove the redirect from your app execution aliases</a> if you already have Python installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally I also installed mingw32-make using <code>emsdk install mingw-7.1.0-64bit</code>. I&rsquo;m unsure if this is needed on Linux or Mac, however if you do need anything extra then a good place to start is to check the tool packages available through Emscripten by calling <code>emsdk list</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out there aren&rsquo;t many IDE plugins or integrations for Emscripten. I tried to integrate it as much as I can into CLion, but what I managed to get to work caused issues for me later on. Emscripten relies on its own compilers and linkers a lot, so I would recommend sticking solely to the terminal in order to save yourself some headaches.</p>
<h2 id="cmake-and-emscripten">CMake and Emscripten</h2>
<p>Since my emulator is a not a single file as in the Mozilla examples mentioned in the section above, the most appropriate way to compile the emulator was to use CMake. I took the compiler flags mentioned in the Mozilla examples and added them to my <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="color:#a6e22e">set</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> -s WASM=1 --shell-file </span><span style="color:#e6db74">${</span>CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">/web/shell_minimal.html&#34;</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Next I created a sub-directory in my root project directory for my CMake output (called <code>cmake-build-emscripten</code>) and called the following from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To generate the project build system:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">emcmake cmake -G <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles&#34;</span> ..
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>To compile the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mingw32-make
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-cmake-problems">Potential CMake problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using C++17 features, you may get <code>No such file or directory</code> errors referencing certain headers. This can be caused by accidentally compiling the code outside of Emscripten either by yourself or by your IDE. The sure-fire way to fix these is to clear the CMake project build system directory and re-create it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have some sort of shell in your <code>PATH</code>, you may get the error: <code>For MinGW make to work correctly sh.exe must NOT be in your path</code>. To fix this, add <code>-DCMAKE_SH=&quot;CMAKE_SH-NOTFOUND&quot;</code> to the <code>emcmake cmake</code> command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adding-emscripten-sections-to-cmakelists">Adding Emscripten sections to CMakeLists</h3>
<p>I wanted to maintain the ability to compile my code natively as well as being able to compile it using Emscripten. <strong>The CMake <code>EMSCRIPTEN</code> variable solves this problem, as it&rsquo;s set to true when compiling with Emscripten</strong>. I already had sections for building on Windows and Linux in my <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, but there was a small quirk involved in adding Emscripten to it too: the CMake <code>UNIX</code> variable will be true when compiling using Emscripten. This can be a problem if your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> logic looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">UNIX</span>)
  <span style="color:#75715e"># Linux specific commands
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">elseif</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">EMSCRIPTEN</span>)
  <span style="color:#75715e"># Emscripten specific commands
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">elseif</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">WIN32</span>)
  <span style="color:#75715e"># Windows specific commands
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">endif</span> ()
</code></pre></div><p>In this case, the Emscripten block won&rsquo;t get executed when compiling with Emscripten as it will go down the <code>UNIX</code> branch. This may not be an issue if you&rsquo;re only targeting a Unix based system and Emscripten as you could branch on <code>if (EMSCRIPTEN)</code>, but could be a problem if you&rsquo;re target non-Unix based systems alongside Emscripten. Since I wanted my Emscripten block to come after Windows and Linux, my fixed <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> has the following structure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">WIN32</span>)
  <span style="color:#75715e"># Windows specific commands
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">elseif</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">UNIX</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">AND</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">NOT</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">EMSCRIPTEN</span>)
  <span style="color:#75715e"># Linux specific commands
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">elseif</span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">EMSCRIPTEN</span>)
  <span style="color:#75715e"># Emscripten specific commands
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">endif</span> ()
</code></pre></div><p>For my full CMakeLists.txt you can check the source <a href="https://github.com/dominikrys/chip8/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="initial-compile">Initial compile</h2>
<p>I was almost ready to compile the code. Since the emulator is using <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</a> for audio and graphics, I also needed to specify the <code>-s USE_SDL=2</code> compiler flag. When this is specified, Emscripten will automatically download the <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-ports/SDL2">SDL2 Emscripten port</a>.</p>
<p>I compiled the source code, completely unaltered:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">Emscripten Release

</code></pre></div><p>It&hellip; worked? I hosted the generated page locally with Python</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">python3 -m http.server
</code></pre></div><p>And had a look at it in Chrome. I found that the screen was blank, but in the JavaScript console I got the usage of my program printed, followed by an exception.</p>
<p><img src="img/cpp-chip8-emulator-to-webassembly/first-compile-error.png" alt="First Compile Error"></p>
<p>That makes sense, as natively the emulator expects to be given a ROM to load as a command line argument. After hard-coding a path to Pong and removing my command line argument handling code, I was left with this exception:</p>
<p><img src="img/cpp-chip8-emulator-to-webassembly/exception-after-fix.png" alt="Exception after fix"></p>
<p>This time I actually had to work out what the exception is. Time to attempt some debugging!</p>
<h2 id="debugging-emscripten">Debugging Emscripten</h2>
<p>Investigating the JavaScript exception isn&rsquo;t particularly useful, as at that point the code has been generated by Emscripten and is very different to the source code. There is a section on debugging in the <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/Debugging.html">Emscripten docs</a>, but in essence the debugging process isn&rsquo;t particularly expansive and will require some poking around the C/C++ code.</p>
<p>The most helpful ways to debug my code I found were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Setting the <code>ASSERTIONS=2</code> compiler flag. This gives you a better idea of what&rsquo;s going on, but isn&rsquo;t particularly useful by itself. I also found this flag to crop up with red herrings sometimes which got me debugging issues that were either fine to ignore, or went away by themselves as I developed more of the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/Debugging.html#handling-c-exceptions-from-javascript">Handling C++ exceptions from JavaScript</a>. This requires some extra compiler and linker arguments and some extra code, but will give you readable exceptions in the JavaScript console. Very useful if you know which function is throwing exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/Debugging.html#manual-print-debugging">Manual print statements</a>. Not particularly sophisticated, but works well enough and helped me debug this first exception. Note that you should flush using <code>std::endl</code> or similar when using <code>std::cout</code> statements or else your messages won&rsquo;t get printed (or will get printed when the program terminates).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-system-access-in-emscripten">File system access in Emscripten</h2>
<p>The reason for the exception turned out to be simple - it couldn&rsquo;t find the ROM I specified to load. The reason for this is that WebAssembly is designed to be secure and <strong>to run in a sandboxed execution environment</strong> - the file that I was trying to load was present on the &ldquo;server&rdquo;, but not in the WASM sandbox.</p>
<p>To use files within Emscripten, a <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html">File System API is provided</a> as well as a way to <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/files/packaging_files.html#packaging-files">package files</a>. Since I already had the C++ code for reading files, I went down the packaging files route. There are two <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html#emcc-preload-file">compiler options</a> that can do this job:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>--preload-file &lt;name&gt;</code>: allows you to pre-load a file or directory before running the compiled code asynchronously. The result is a <code>.data</code> file alongside your generated <code>.html</code> and <code>.js</code> which contains the preloaded files. This is the option I went with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--embed-file &lt;file&gt;</code>: allows you to embed a file or path into the generated script. The result is that the files will be embedded inside your generated <code>.js</code> file. This is less efficient than pre-loading and should only be used when there are few files to load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After packaging the files, they can be accessed with file API calls from your C/C++ code as if the files existed locally.</p>
<p>Once I packaged the files properly, everything compiled again. I checked the website and there weren&rsquo;t any exceptions there, but the output was blank and the page was frozen:</p>
<p><img src="img/cpp-chip8-emulator-to-webassembly/blank-emscripten.png" alt="Blank Emscripten"></p>
<p>I also got the following warning:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">The AudioContext was not allowed to start. It must be resumed (or created) after a user gesture on the page. https://goo.gl/7K7WLu
</code></pre></div><p>For the time being, I decided to get rid of the audio handling code and sort it out later.</p>
<h2 id="emscripten-loops">Emscripten loops</h2>
<p>To get the screen buffer to update and not freeze the tab, I had to change the current loop that my current emulator runs on into an <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/emscripten-runtime-environment.html#browser-main-loop">Emscripten loop</a>. The reasoning for this is that the web browser event model uses co-operative multitasking, so each event gets a turn to run and has to return control to the browser. My code was blocking and never gave control back to the browser, which is why the tab froze and the display didn&rsquo;t update.</p>
<p>After a quick Google looking for some real-world examples on how to write an Emscripten loop, I found <a href="https://www.jamesfmackenzie.com/2019/12/03/webassembly-emscripten-loops/">James MacKenzie&rsquo;s blog</a> which has been a huge help on getting this to work.</p>
<p>A traditional loop in a C++ program using SDL looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span>(running) {
    renderFrame();
    SDL_Delay(timeToNextFrame());
}
</code></pre></div><p>And once rewritten to use Emscripten loops look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">emscripten_set_main_loop(renderFrame, <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Where the full signature of <code>emscripten_set_main_loop</code> is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">emscripten_set_main_loop(em_callback_func func, <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> fps, <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> simulate_infinite_loop)
</code></pre></div><p><code>emscripten_set_main_loop()</code> simulates an infinite loop, but in reality just calls the loop function a specified number of times a second. The amount of times that this loop gets called a second is specified by the second argument, however the <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html#c.emscripten_set_main_loop">Emscripten docs</a> mention that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;<strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommended&rdquo; to set this to 0 or a negative value when doing any rendering. The site will then use the browser’s <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> method to call the main loop function (more on this later).</p>
<h3 id="major-rewrite">Major rewrite</h3>
<p>There is a major side effect of having to call a global function in my main loop - every object called within that global function also has to be accessible globally, or be local to that function.</p>
<p>My code wasn&rsquo;t designed with this in mind and would have been structured differently if I was writing it for Emscripten from the start. Anyway, I had to make a couple of objects global at the top of my <code>Main.cpp</code> file to make it accessible from the main loop. It&rsquo;s not a particularly elegant solution, but for this relatively simple project it sufficed.</p>
<p>As an effect of writing code this way your IDE may also complain about not being able to catch exceptions from variables with static storage duration - this is not a problem, and Emscripten will still be able to catch them for us if we add the exception handling in Javasript code that was described in the <a href="#debugging-emscripten">debugging section</a>.</p>
<p>My code went from looking something like this:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>At this point I&rsquo;ve also added a separate <code>Main.cpp</code> file just for Emscripten and added rules to pick up the right one in <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> depending on the compiler. The code has diverged a lot from my original <code>Main.cpp</code>, and adding preprocessor directives wasn&rsquo;t a good solution any more as they made the code difficult to trace through.</p>
<h3 id="emterpreter">Emterpreter</h3>
<p>Due to the amount of effort that may be required to rewrite traditional loops into Emscripten loops, depending on your project, Emscripten also provides <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/wiki/Emterpreter">Emterpreter</a>. This allow you to keep traditional loops by adding <code>emscripten_sleep()</code> calls to your code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span>(running) {
    renderFrame();
    emscripten_sleep(timeToNextFrame());
}
</code></pre></div><p>I gave this a go myself before rewriting my code for <code>emscripten_set_main_loop()</code> as I thought this could be a nice way to get things working quickly, but I found it to be a cumbersome process for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Emterpreter is not available on the default LLVM backend that Emscripten uses. It&rsquo;s necessary to switch to the <code>fastcomp</code> backend, which is considered a legacy backend by Emscripten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When compiling the code, you get various messages mentioning that code compiled using Emterpreter may run slowly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emterpreter seems to only be recommended to be used when absolutely necessary by the <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/8561">Emscripten devs</a>, and even then only by certain parts of your program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It simply didn&rsquo;t work for my project. I got various errors and decided to switch back and to it the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; way, as also more support would be available for doing things that way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="frame-rate-issues">Frame rate issues</h3>
<p>I compiled the code after rewriting using an Emscripten loop and this was the result:</p>
<p><img src="img/cpp-chip8-emulator-to-webassembly/working-emulator.png" alt="Working Emulator"></p>
<p>It worked! Although very slowly. I found that this is to do with the <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> method which I mentioned previously that is used to call the Emscripten main loop function.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">Mozilla docs</a> state that <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> gets called &ldquo;usually 60 times per second, but will generally match the display refresh rate in most web browsers&rdquo;. This was a problem, as my main loop simulated <strong>one</strong> CHIP-8 cycle every time it was called. Effectively this meant that my the emulator ran at a frequency of 60Hz when compiled with Emscripten, where most CHIP-8 ROMs run well at 1000-1500Hz.</p>
<p>To fix this issue, I added a constant which determines how many cycles to emulate every time the main Emscripten loop is given control. Calculating this constant wasn&rsquo;t very straightforward, as the frame rate which ran natively didn&rsquo;t directly translate to what ran in Emscripten.</p>
<p>For example, if I ran a game at 1000Hz natively, I should be able to divide that by 60 to get the amount of cycles I should emulate every frame in an Emscripten loop, which is around 17 in this case. This didn&rsquo;t appear to be the case however, as the Emscripten loop ran much faster than anticipated: to get an Emscripten loop running at a similar speed to one running natively at 1000Hz, I set the amount of loops to emulate per frame to 10. I found this through a process of trial-and-error as there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a good way to calculate this value upfront.</p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s worth nothing that not every screen will refresh at 60 frames a second, which is something to consider if you want the program to run at the same speed for everyone.</p>
<p>The logic for emulating a set amount of cycles per frame looked as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> cyclesPerFrame <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>;

<span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">mainLoop</span>() {
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> (<span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> i <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>; i <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;</span> cyclesPerFrame; i<span style="color:#f92672">++</span>)
    {
        chip8.cycle();
    }
}

<span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span>() {
    emscripten_set_main_loop(mainLoop, <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>After compiling the emulator again with this change, everything worked as expected. Surprisingly, the keyboard also worked perfectly and didn&rsquo;t require any intervention.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-c-functions-to-call-from-javascript">Exporting C++ functions to call from JavaScript</h2>
<p>To finish this off, I wanted to add a dropdown so it&rsquo;s possible to select a game to load (turns out Pong gets a bit boring after a while). First, I added a function to my C++ code which will get exported so it can be called from JavaScript. There is a page in <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/Interacting-with-code.html">the Emscripted docs</a> which explains this in good detail. The function looked as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span style="color:#66d9ef">extern</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;C&#34;</span> {
<span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">loadRom</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>path, <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> cyclesPerFrame_) {
    cyclesPerFrame <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> cyclesPerFrame_;

    chip8.reset();
    chip8.loadRom(path);
}
}
</code></pre></div><p>The function is wrapped in <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code> to prevent C++ name mangling. I also added a <code>cyclesPerFrame_</code> parameter as many CHIP-8 ROMs need to have their frame rate adjusted to run at an appropriate speed.</p>
<p>Next, I exported the function to enable it to be called from JavaScript. In order to call a C++ function from JavaScript, I also need to export the runtime <code>ccall</code> and/or <code>cwrap</code> methods which are called on the <code>Module</code> JavaScript object which <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/module.html">the Emscripten-generated code calls at various points in its execution</a>. To do this, I added the following to my compiler flags:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="color:#f92672">-</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">s</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">\</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;[&#39;_main&#39;, &#39;_loadRom&#39;]</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">\&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74"> \

</span><span style="color:#e6db74">-s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 \
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">--no-heap-copy \
</span></code></pre></div><p>Note that I also exported <code>main</code> as I want to be able to call the main function myself and not start it automatically when the page is loaded. The <code>-s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1</code> and <code>--no-heap-copy</code> flags are necessary as the memory used by the WASM code will increase when we load a game. This shouldn&rsquo;t <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/optimizing/Optimizing-Code.html#memory-growth">have any overhead</a> when compiling to WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Next, I made some changes to the <code>shell.html</code> file:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I set <code>noInitialRun</code> to <code>true</code> in the JavaScript <code>Module</code> object so it doesn&rsquo;t automatically run the emulator when the page loads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a dropdown for selecting which ROM to load. Each option includes a path to a ROM to load and specifies the amount of cycles to emulate per frame.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">div</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;emscripten&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">id</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;menu&#34;</span>&gt;

  &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">select</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">div</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Added a JavaScript listener to check for changes in the dropdown when the WebAssembly code has loaded, and call the exported C++ function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">getRomOptionsFromDropdown</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">optionText</span>) {

<li>Note that JavaScript strings are not null terminated. Since we&rsquo;re passing the string with the ROM path from JavaScript to C++ code, we have to append a null character manually as C and C++ strings must be null-terminated. If the string is not null-terminated, then certain C++ functions which rely on the string being null-terminated won&rsquo;t work as expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>
<p>I mentioned that I&rsquo;d come back to audio earlier in this post. In my emulator I coded the audio as a sine wave (all I wanted was a simple &ldquo;beep&rdquo; sound so no need for an audio file) which gets played on a separate thread. To compile the code I had to add some extra compiler flags as described in the <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/pthreads.html">Emscripten Pthreads support page</a> to allow for multithreading in Emscripten.</p>
<p>I compiled the code with the audio enabled and checked how Chrome treats it. The audio played when it should, however it ended up being a horrible high pitched noise which changed frequency and didn&rsquo;t stop, where it should have been a short &ldquo;beep&rdquo; sound. Changing various settings didn&rsquo;t seem to have an effect on the noise produced. I also gave it a go in Firefox, which required me to enable a flag as the support in Firefox for Webassembly pthreads is currently experimental. Once the flag was enabled, Firefox had various issues with the audio device and I didn&rsquo;t see pursuing this any further worthwhile.</p>
<p>In order to make this work, I think the best way would be to handle the audio entirely from JavaScript and query the emulator for when a sound should play. Since I didn&rsquo;t see much value in adding sound to the emulator, I left it out.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-touches">Finishing touches</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it - I managed to compile the emulator into WebAssembly, I added the ability to play different games and to host the emulator online. To finish the emulator off, I added some CSS styling, a start/stop button and instructions on how to play which was easy to do by editing the default Emscripten shell file.</p>
<p>An extra thing which was worth doing is checking how the site behaved in Firefox. For example, I made the assumption in my JavaScript code that the game picker dropdown will always not have a game selected when the page is loaded, which is how Chrome works by default. Firefox on the other hand remembers what the last option that the user picked in a dropdown was, so I had to handle that case accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="end">End</h2>
<p>I hope this post was somewhat insightful for anyone looking at compiling their own C or C++ code into WebAssembly. I think there&rsquo;s huge potential in the technology, and can be very useful for computationally expensive tasks which aren&rsquo;t viable to be ran using JavaScript.</p>
<p>For examples of more sophisticated projects using WebAssembly, have a look at <a href="https://madewithwebassembly.com/">this site</a> which describes how various projects (including popular ones such as <a href="https://madewithwebassembly.com/showcase/opencv">OpenCV</a> and <a href="https://madewithwebassembly.com/showcase/tensorflow">Tensorflow</a>) use WASM.</p>
<p>Links to the source code and the compiled emulator in WebAssembly are provided at the top of this post.</p>

            <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dom. Welcome to my first blog post!
My main objective for this blog is to start documenting my work more. Having had completed some small side projects and interning at some companies, I wanted a place to document the details of my past work. I thought that a blog is the perfect place for this.
The tech stack I used to set up this blog is quite straightforward. Hugo is the static site generator responsible for most of the heavy work, allowing me to write posts simply in Markdown.</description>

<p>My main objective for this blog is to start documenting my work more. Having had completed some small side projects and interning at some companies, I wanted a place to document the details of my past work. I thought that a blog is the perfect place for this.</p>
<p>The tech stack I used to set up this blog is quite straightforward. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is the static site generator responsible for most of the heavy work, allowing me to write posts simply in Markdown. The site is then hosted on GitHub Pages (with <a href="https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/">Jekyll bypassed</a>).</p>
<p>Alternative static site generators I&rsquo;ve also considered are <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gatsby is arguably a more popular solution, however supposedly <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gatsby-vs-hugo-a-detailed-comparison-e78d94f640fc/">requires knowledge of React</a>. I was looking for an easily maintainable solution which &ldquo;just works&rdquo;, so Hugo seemed like a winner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jekyll is used by default on GitHub pages so it felt like the more natural choice. I&rsquo;ve tried to set it up in the past to have a GitHub pages page redirect to another site (which I quickly found I don&rsquo;t need Jekyll for), but the set-up process was horrible. I&rsquo;ve tried it on Windows and Linux, and ran into lots of issues with it requiring certain Ruby versions and specific environment settings. Hugo worked out of the box.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I got the final nudge to get to work with this blog after reading the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work">Show Your Work</a> by Austin Kleon. I highly recommend it as it&rsquo;s short and packed with plenty of useful advice.</p>
<p>I hope you find the content on this blog useful!</p>

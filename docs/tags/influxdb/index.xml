      <description>Motivation During my last internship, I&amp;rsquo;ve been tasked with designing and deploying infrastructure for monitoring a cluster of machines that were used for performance testing. I wrote a blog post detailing high-level choices about it which you can check out here. The post also includes justifications for why I chose to deploy everything in Docker, and why I chose to work with Grafana and InfluxDB as the front-end and time-series database, respectively.</description>

      <description>This post is also hosted on the Corda Blog. The main goal behind this post was to provide an easily accessible high-level overview on monitoring Corda nodes. It also showcases part of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done during my summer internship at R3.
 Intro Here at R3, we have a cluster of Corda nodes that we use for performance testing. We have developed a performance testing suite that enables us to establish baseline numbers, quantify improvements from new features, and identify regressions.</description>

      <description>For part of my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s dissertation, I implemented and executed a bit-flipping attack on encrypted IP packets in LTE networks. The attack was first documented by David Rupprecht et al. in their academic paper &amp;ldquo;Breaking LTE on Layer Two&amp;rdquo;.
The attack is possible due to a specification flaw in LTE standards, where IP packets are not integrity protected. Therefore, a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can modify the packets and the receiver will decrypt them successfully since it can&amp;rsquo;t verify the authenticity of the data.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to disable the validation of UDP checksums of incoming packets on a Linux machine for a security project. To my surprise, there weren&amp;rsquo;t any satisfactory solutions that I could easily find online related to this. The top results also suggested disabling checksum offloading, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t disable checksum checking. In the end, I managed to figure this problem out and found that it&amp;rsquo;s possible without recompiling the kernel. In this short post, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how to set up a Linux machine to ignore UDP checksums in received packets.</description>

      <title>How to Transparently Proxy IP Packets With Spoofed Destinations</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently worked on a security project which required me to transparently/interceptingly (if that&amp;rsquo;s a word) proxy IP packets that have had their destination IPs spoofed. By this, I mean that the destination IP in an IP packet is not the IP of the destination which a DNS request would correctly resolve. For example, this could be due to a DNS query being spoofed and sending an IP address of another destination in reply.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working with Terraform a lot at work. However, I was never taught properly how it works. I jumped straight into the code and figured things out, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly difficult. Nevertheless, I was curious as to what I was missing and how I could set Terraform up myself in a new project. Therefore, I looked at how I could learn Terraform on my own.
After some initial looking around, I found Zeal Vora&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate&amp;rsquo; course on Udemy to be well-regarded.</description>

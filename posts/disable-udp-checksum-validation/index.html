The top Google results suggest disabling checksum offloading, which doesn’t disable checksum validation. Another result mentions a solution from within application source code, which you may not have access to or be able to modify.\nIn the end, I managed to figure this problem out and found that it’s usually possible without recompiling the kernel.\nIn this post, I’ll describe how to set up a Linux machine to ignore UDP checksums in received packets. The mentioned steps may also be adapted to allow for disabling TCP checksum checking.\nCheck If Your Machine Can Receive Packets with Broken UDP Checksums Firstly, we need to check if your machine can already accept packets with invalid UDP checksums. This is necessary as your machine might already be able to receive them, but applications that are then passed the packets could be discarding them. Verifying this is also necessary to check if your network is capable of receiving packets with broken UDP checksums; there could be firewalls in place that verify packets before they reach your machine, in which case those will need to be reconfigured first.\nTesting if your machine can already receive packets with broken checksums is straightforward - send packets with broken UDP checksums from one machine (source machine) to the machine that you want to disable UDP checksum validation on (destination machine), and check the traffic using tcpdump. I’ll outline how I’ve done this below.\nRun tcpdump on the destination machine, listening to internet traffic at the port that you expect to receive packets with broken UDP checksums on:\nsudo tcpdump -i dst port -vv To get the network interface names, you can run ip link show.\nDisable transmit checksum offloading on the source machine. This is so that any packets with invalid checksums won’t have their checksums corrected by hardware. In some cases, it may not be possible to disable this, so another machine may need to be used to send packets. To disable transmit checksum offloading on Linux, run:\nsudo ethtool --offload tx off Download and run Scapy on the source machine.\nCraft a packet of the with a broken UDP checksum using Scapy on the source machine. This is an example for how to do this with DNS packets:\nbad_packet = IP(dst='') / UDP() / DNS(rd=1, qd=DNSQR(qname=\"www.example.com\")) Send the packet with a broken checksum from the source to the destination machine:\nsend(bad_packet) Check the tcpdump logs on the destination machine. If the packet is received stating bad udp cksum in the logs, the machine can receive packets with broken UDP checksums. We can then continue with adding nftables rules to ignore the checksums.\nWhat If My Machine Doesn’t Receive Packets with Invalid UDP Checksums? A router between your machines could discard the packet due to an incorrect UDP checksum. Such an issue can be hard to diagnose, so it may be circumvented by sending packets from another machine.\nIf the packet is still not received, the kernel may be rejecting packets with invalid UDP checksums. In such case, the udp_recvmsg() function in the kernel would need to be modified to not return errors when the checksum validation fails. The kernel would then need to be recompiled - this can differ slightly between Linux distros, but many include useful documentation on how to achieve this (such as this for Ubuntu).\nNote that changes to the kernel were not needed on the three machines that I have tested this on (Ubuntu 18.04 in Microsoft Azure, Ubuntu 20.10 in DigitalOcean, and Arch Linux with kernel version 5.11.11) but your mileage may vary.\nIgnoring UDP checksums with nftables So far, we’ve confirmed that packets with broken UDP checksums can be received by our machine. However, these packets won’t get accepted by any target applications due to the invalid checksum. We can fix this using nftables.\nWe can configure nftables rules that set the UDP checksum of received packets to 0 before they’re passed to any applications. Packets with UDP checksums of 0 will not have their checksums validated, effectively disabling UDP checksum validation.\nTo set this up, first install nftables with your favourite package manager. Next, add the following nftables rule:\nsudo nft add table input_table sudo nft 'add chain input_table input {type filter hook input priority -300;}' sudo nft 'add rule input_table input ip protocol udp udp checksum set 0' This rule will set the UDP checksum of every received IP UDP packet to 0, which applications won’t validate.\nYour machine will now ignore UDP checksums of received packets! Feel free to test this using Scapy.\nTo make the rule persistent across reboots, I’d recommend following the advice in this short guide to nftables.\nIgnoring UDP Checksums Using Socket Options If you have the source code of the application that you want to send the packets with broken UDP checksums to, it may be possible by using socket options. To do so, the SO_NO_CHECK option would need to be declared with the UDP socket file descriptor, as described here.\n","wordCount":"874","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://dominikrys.com/img/cover.jpg","datePublished":"2021-05-20T12:37:22+01:00","dateModified":"2021-05-20T12:37:22+01:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dominikrys.com/posts/disable-udp-checksum-validation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dominik Rys","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dominikrys.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dominikrys.com accesskey=h title="Dominik Rys (Alt + H)">Dominik Rys</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://dominikrys.com/tags title=🔖 Tags><span>🔖 Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>How to Disable UDP Checksum Validation in Linux</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-05-20 12:37:22 +0100 +0100'>May 20, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy srcset="https://dominikrys.com/posts/disable-udp-checksum-validation/img/cover_hu2951eddb1aeb50704a2b7f5eae027ef1_1599645_360x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 360w ,https://dominikrys.com/posts/disable-udp-checksum-validation/img/cover_hu2951eddb1aeb50704a2b7f5eae027ef1_1599645_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w ,https://dominikrys.com/posts/disable-udp-checksum-validation/img/cover_hu2951eddb1aeb50704a2b7f5eae027ef1_1599645_720x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 720w ,https://dominikrys.com/posts/disable-udp-checksum-validation/img/cover_hu2951eddb1aeb50704a2b7f5eae027ef1_1599645_1080x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1080w ,https://dominikrys.com/posts/disable-udp-checksum-validation/img/cover_hu2951eddb1aeb50704a2b7f5eae027ef1_1599645_1500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1500w ,https://dominikrys.com/posts/disable-udp-checksum-validation/img/cover.jpg 5992w" sizes="(min-width: 768px) 720px, 100vw" src=https://dominikrys.com/posts/disable-udp-checksum-validation/img/cover.jpg alt width=5992 height=2471></figure><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#check-if-your-machine-can-receive-packets-with-broken-udp-checksums aria-label="Check If Your Machine Can Receive Packets with Broken UDP Checksums">Check If Your Machine Can Receive Packets with Broken UDP Checksums</a><ul><li><a href=#what-if-my-machine-doesnt-receive-packets-with-invalid-udp-checksums aria-label="What If My Machine Doesn’t Receive Packets with Invalid UDP Checksums?">What If My Machine Doesn’t Receive Packets with Invalid UDP Checksums?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#ignoring-udp-checksums-with-nftables aria-label="Ignoring UDP checksums with nftables">Ignoring UDP checksums with nftables</a></li><li><a href=#ignoring-udp-checksums-using-socket-options aria-label="Ignoring UDP Checksums Using Socket Options">Ignoring UDP Checksums Using Socket Options</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>I recently needed to disable the validation of UDP checksums of incoming packets on a Linux machine for a security project.

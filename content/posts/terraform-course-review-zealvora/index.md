I've recently been working with Terraform a fair amount at work. I never got any formal guidance on how it works, however, and mostly jumped straight in to the code. It wasn't particularly hard to figure out, but I was curious as to what I was missing and how I could set it up myself in a new project. Therefore, I looked at how I could learn Terraform on my own.

After some initial looking around, I found [Zeal Vora's 'HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate' course](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraform/comments/jfzerz/comment/g9nio4h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Udemy to be fairly well-regarded. Now, I'm not a fan of courses as I'd much rather get stuck in to a project of my own and minimise the hand-holding that most online courses and tutorials give you. In this case however, since I didn't have deploying any complicated infrastructure in mind, a course seemed like a good way to learn it.

In this post, I describe my experience while working through the course and aim to answer whether it was worth the time and monetary investment. Bury in mind that my intention was not to do the course to get ready for the [Terraform Associate certification](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate), but I'll give an insight into this also from the practice tests that are offered.

## Course structure

The course is structured into distinct sections, starting from Terraform basics and building up on them. Towards the end, the instructor delves into more in-depth topics as well Terraform Cloud and Enterprise capabilities which are needed for the certification. Right at the end, there is also a handy exam preparation section.

I found the structure of the course to be just right. It's clear that the instructor has planned it well. As someone who wasn't focussing too hard on the final sections which are only really relevant to the exam, you can could also finish it early and not miss any vital information for using Terraform in a professional scenario.

## Supporting materials

## TODO

- prefer written content for reference
- Learning a fair bit about AWS
- Nice to set up Terraform from scratch (usually in company it's all done for you)
- Useful snippets in repo 
- i made my own notes
- Running on 2x speed 
- notes at the end of each module
- nice that it shows aws and digitaocean
- gives background on how terraform works that you may not pick up on the job (e.g. how does terraform know what to destroy i.e. how does it know that it craeted that resource? i was thinking it's to do with some secret tags)
- created notes for myself as i went
- very clear and easy to explain. very well explained, may be great for beginners
- covers main concepts well, things you might not encounter in general use
- would be nice to have workshops and independent exercises
- too pedantic at times, e.g. showing how to reference maps and lists/arrays
- repo is not in a good order, files all over the place. the instructor encourages you to create a different folder for every lecture/lesson, but doesn't follow his own advice. makes things hard to reference
- storing secrets in plain text and doesn't say anything about this being the wrong way to do things, doesn't even mention that he will pick up on it later
  - picks up on it later, but doesnt go very in depth inb terms of how secrets can be stored
  - goes in to aws
- inconsistent naming - uses dashes where tf discourages it, concatenates multiple words into one
- nice format - go through theory, then show how it works in practice
- doesn't state that provisioners are not recommended. Should only be used as a last resort.
- tertraform cloud covered which i didn't care about, but it's needed for the exam
- was it worth it - money and time
- grammarly

      <title>How to Transparently Proxy IP Packets With Spoofed Destinations</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently worked on a security project which required me to transparently proxy IP packets that have had their destination IPs spoofed. By this, I mean that the destination IP in an IP packet is not the IP of the destination which a DNS request would correctly resolve. For example, this could be due to a DNS query being spoofed and sending an IP address of another destination in reply. The diagram above shows what we want to achieve.</description>

      <title>Configuring Squid as a Transparent Proxy</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently set up Squid as a transparent proxy for a security project. What should have been relatively straightforward had me browsing through tutorials from over 10 years ago that don&amp;rsquo;t quite work any more. After comparing this prehistoric knowledge with some supposedly up-to-date documentation, I managed to understand enough about Squid to get a minimal transparent proxy configuration on a modern version of Linux hosted in the cloud.
With the hopes of saving someone some time that may be embarking on a similar journey, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write this post.</description>

      <title>Executing Stream Cipher Attacks on IP Packets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For part of my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s dissertation, I implemented and executed a bit-flipping attack on encrypted IP packets in LTE networks. The attack was first documented by David Rupprecht et al. in their academic paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://alter-attack.net/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Breaking LTE on Layer Two&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack is possible due to a specification flaw in LTE standards, where IP packets are &lt;strong&gt;not integrity protected&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can modify the packets and the receiver will decrypt them successfully since it can&amp;rsquo;t verify the authenticity of the data. This kind of attack is not specific to LTE networks, however, and can be executed in different environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Debug srsLTE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working extensively with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE&#34;&gt;srsLTE&lt;/a&gt; for my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s dissertation. So far, the greatest difficulty has been debugging the software. In this short post, I will describe various ways I found that srsLTE can be debugged, and any pitfalls that come with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll assume you know how to debug ordinary C/C++ programs (I&amp;rsquo;ll patiently wait here if you need to have a look into that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;compiling-srslte-in-debug-mode&#34;&gt;Compiling srsLTE in Debug Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first attempt at debugging may have been to compile with the &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; CMake flag, and then executing the binaries using GDB or another debugger:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Compiling My C&#43;&#43; CHIP-8 Emulator to WebAssembly</title>
      <link>https://dominikrys.com/posts/compiling-chip8-to-wasm/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 16:55:48 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dominikrys.com/posts/compiling-chip8-to-wasm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dominikrys/chip8&#34;&gt;CHIP-8 emulator&lt;/a&gt; in C++17, as I wanted to learn about emulation and expand my C++ knowledge outside of work. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I went about compiling the emulator which was designed to run natively, to also run on the web using the magic of WebAssembly. You can try out the result &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dominikrys.com/chip8&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main motivation for getting the emulator working on the web was that in its current state, it took some effort to get it up and running. I could send someone the pre-compiled binary or give building instructions, but those aren&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed to work on every platform. Ideally, I wanted a solution that can be hosted on the web, and I recently heard about this cool new &amp;ldquo;WebAssembly&amp;rdquo; which seemed perfect for the job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

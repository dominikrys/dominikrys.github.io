      <title>Compiling My C&#43;&#43; CHIP-8 Emulator to WebAssembly</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dominikrys/chip8&#34;&gt;CHIP-8 emulator&lt;/a&gt; in C++17, as I wanted to learn about emulation and expand my C++ knowledge outside of work. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I went about compiling the emulator which was designed to run natively, to also run on the web using the magic of WebAssembly. You can try out the result &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dominikrys.com/chip8&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main motivation for getting the emulator working on the web was that in its current state, it took some effort to get it up and running. I could send someone the pre-compiled binary or give building instructions, but those aren&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed to work on every platform. Ideally, I wanted a solution that can be hosted on the web, and I recently heard about this cool new &amp;ldquo;WebAssembly&amp;rdquo; which seemed perfect for the job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

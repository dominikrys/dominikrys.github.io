      <title>HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Course Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working with Terraform a lot at work. However, I was never taught properly how it works. I jumped straight into the code and figured things out, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly difficult. Nevertheless, I was curious as to what I was missing and how I could set Terraform up myself in a new project. Therefore, I looked at how I could learn Terraform on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some initial looking around, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraform/comments/jfzerz/comment/g9nio4h/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&#34;&gt;Zeal Vora&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate&amp;rsquo; course&lt;/a&gt; on Udemy to be well-regarded. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of courses. I&amp;rsquo;d much rather get stuck into a project of my own and avoid the hand-holding that most courses offer. In the case of Terraform though, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have deploying any complicated infrastructure in mind, completing a course seemed like the right approach. The instructor of the course also seemed credible, seeing as he&amp;rsquo;s released many courses on Cloud Engineering topics and works as a Cloud Security Consultant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Caveats to Creating Datadog Log Metrics in Terraform</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I give an overview of how to create Datadog Log Metrics in Terraform. Having had done this recently, I encountered a couple of caveats that warranted documenting. Hopefully it will help others that encountered similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post assumes that you have a basic configuration for Datadog in Terraform already. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/managing-datadog-with-terraform/&#34;&gt;Datadog&amp;rsquo;s post on managing Datadog with Terraform&lt;/a&gt; is a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;datadog-terraform-resources&#34;&gt;Datadog Terraform Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three Terraform resources that you can use to configure log metrics in Datadog:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

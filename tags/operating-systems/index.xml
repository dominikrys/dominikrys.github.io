      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently graduated with a Computer Science degree from the University of Birmingham. Overall, the course covered most of the fundamentals of computer science. However, the course structure changed when I was on my year in industry, causing me to completely miss out on operating systems modules! Since I&amp;rsquo;ve always been quite interested in operating systems, I decided to teach myself about them.
In this short post, I will cover what online resources I found to be particularly useful in teaching myself about OSes.</description>

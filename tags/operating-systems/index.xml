      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently graduated with a Computer Science degree. Overall, the course covered most of the fundamentals of computer science. However, the course structure changed when I was on my year in industry, causing me to completely miss out on operating systems modules! Since I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in operating systems, I decided to teach myself about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this short post, I will cover what online resources I found to be particularly useful in teaching myself about operating systems. Iâ€™ll mention resources ranging from ones that can be gone through in a couple of hours to acquire some surface-level knowledge, to those that will take a bit longer but prepare you to write the next Unix successor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
